# nft-game

This is a game that lets you fight collaboratively against a boss. The characters are in the form of a nft. The HP of each nft changes dynamically after every successful attack.I have used React.js in the frontend of this webapp. In the backend I have put a smart contract in place that controls all the logic of the game. The game is deployed on the Sepolia testnet.
